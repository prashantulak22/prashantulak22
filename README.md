Interested in IT and everything in its orbit. Recently began to be fascinated by web 
development. Gained some experience working in this area through school projects 
and an internship. As this area compliments my studies, I am keen to gain more 
experience in this field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer 
me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full 
commitment and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team. Therefore,
currently looking for a job as a frontend developer.
